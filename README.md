# Cash Register Simulation

Overview

This project is a Java-based cash register simulation that models the process of a real-world checkout system. The program implements core object-oriented programming (OOP) principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction to simulate interactions between a Buyer, Cashier, CashRegister, and Product.

Features
	•	Simulates product scanning using a UPCScanner.
	•	Calculates total cost and generates a receipt.
	•	Handles payment and verifies available funds.
	•	Uses object-oriented design to maintain clean and modular code.

How to Run
	1.	Clone the repository.
	2.	Compile and run the CashRegisterTester class.
	3.	Follow on-screen instructions to scan products and complete payment.

Code Structure
	•	Buyer.java – Represents the customer and handles payment.
	•	CashRegister.java – Stores and calculates total cost of products.
	•	Product.java – Represents an individual product.
	•	Cashier.java – Handles scanning, payment, and checkout.
	•	UPCScanner.java – Reads product UPC codes.
	•	Inventory.java – Stores product details and manages product lookup.

Technologies Used
	•	Java
	•	Object-Oriented Programming
